Welcome to the Ortobom OceanCare Quiz project - an innovative step towards sustainability. In this README, I'll introduce you to Ortobom's commitment to comfort and the environment through OceanCare technology, and explain the purpose of the quiz I've developed for the Ortobom website.

What is Ortobom?
Ortobom is a mattress brand known for its commitment to both comfort and environmental sustainability. 

Ortobom - Comfort Meets Responsibility:
Ortobom isn't just about mattresses; it's about redefining the way we sleep responsibly. The brand believes that a restful night should also contribute to the planet's well-being. In collaboration with Repreve Our Ocean, Ortobom is making a meaningful impact.

OceanCare Technology - Sustainable Ingenuity:
OceanCare technology is at the heart of this sustainability mission. It ingeniously transforms PET bottles, a common ocean pollutant, into sustainable mattress materials. These materials are used to create Ortobom's Liberty mattress, combining comfort and eco-consciousness.

The Ortobom OceanCare Quiz/Landing Website - My Contribution:
I've played a significant role in Ortobom's mission to educate individuals about sustainability and promote responsible consumption. The quiz and landing page I've developed is a key part of this effort. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I've helped turn a front-end prototype created on Figma into reality by actively working within a team to finetune the robustness, responsiveness and visuals of the Landing Page/Quiz. 

Quiz Highlights:

Knowledge Sharing: The quiz provides insights into how OceanCare technology turns PET bottles into sustainable mattress materials.

Engagement: Through interactive questions about sustainability, the quiz keeps users engaged in a conversation about our planet's health.

Advocacy for Sustainability: The quiz raises awareness and encourages users to consider their environmental impact, nudging them towards sustainable choices.

How It Works:
After completing the quiz, users gain a deeper understanding of Ortobom's commitment to environmental stewardship. The goal is to inspire them to take action towards a more sustainable future. Upon completion, users are redirected to the Ortobom website, where they can explore and purchase a variety of mattress products.
